❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, leading to potential errors (likely `ReferenceError` if `a`
and `b` are not defined in an outer scope).
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible and only usable with global variables named `a` and
`b` (if they exist).
* ❌ Missing semicolon after the function body (although JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion might handle this,
it's best practice to include it explicitly for clarity).

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ Accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function reusable and predictable.
* ✔ The function now works correctly for any two numbers passed as arguments.
* ✔ Implicit return is acceptable for one line functions like this.

Final Note: This improved version is more robust, testable, and adheres to better coding practices. The original relied
on external state, which can make debugging very difficult. By accepting parameters, you make the function
self-contained and easier to reason about.
