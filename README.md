# CodeReviewer

## Overview
CodeReviewer is a simple web application that takes poorly formatted or buggy code as input and returns a refined and corrected version. The application is built using:

- **Frontend:** React (Vite)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express  
- **API:** Gemini Model for code analysis and correction  

## Features
- Submit buggy or poorly formatted code  
- Get suggestions and corrections via the Gemini API  
- Simple and minimal UI for easy usage  
- Option to upload an image for code extraction and review  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)  

### Installation

## Usage
1. Open the frontend in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173` by default).  
2. Enter your buggy or unformatted code.
